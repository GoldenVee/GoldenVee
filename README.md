## Hey! My name is Verance.

</p>
I'm a UX engineer with a passion for frontend development, excellent human-centered design, and priority for accessibility. I'm from Dallas, TX turned Denver, CO transplant to escape the summer heat. Some of my hobbies are making digital art, reading comics, playing video games, and crafting experimental drink recipes. 

My most recent experience involves AI gaming, client-based development, and owning the creation of cross-project component libraries. 

<br/>

<strong> My stacks include: </strong> React, JavaScript/Typescript, Node.js, Next.js, Graphql, Postgresql, React Native, Ruby on Rails, Flutter, & Angular 

<br/>
